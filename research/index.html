    <h2>Research </h2>
    <p>My research is mainly focused on the safe and stable navigation of sailing robots, which rely only on wind for propulsion and have low maneuverability. Coupled with aero and hydrodynamic distur- bances from the environment, this task is extremely challenging. As a core member of my research team, I have been devoted to the front line of ocean experiments for a long time, and strive to help promote the research of sailing robots.</p>

    <p><li>Collision risk assessment of the sailboat itself. Proposed a novel risk assessment strategy to show the regional distribution of collision risk dynami- cally considering the complex environmental factors such as wind, waves, tides and obstacles at sea. To the best knowledge of us, it is the first efficient risk assessment scheme for sailing robots in the world.</p>

    <p><li>Obstacle avoidance and collision avoidance between sailing robots. Basically, avoidance of sailing robots follow the rules of maritime traffic. A coarse-to-fine reinforcement learning framework and a risk assessment besed avoidance scheme were proposed. This part of work has been published in top international conferences [2], [3], [7].</p>

    <p><li> Environmental disturbance consideration. Evaluated the navigation safety and stability based on the analysis of varied wind field, wake of sur- rounding vehicles and tides. Hereby, stability of sailing is guranteed with Lyapunov function. This part of work has been published in top international conference [6] and journal [8].</p>

    <p><li>An application toward long-term ocean observation. Achieved long-term ocean observation by proposing a stable station keeping scheme based on a swithed system approach [13]. The sailing robot realized stable reciprocating observation in radius 0.78km cir- cular area, lasting more than 24 hours.</p>
