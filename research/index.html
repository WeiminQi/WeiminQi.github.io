    <p>My research is mainly focused on the safe and stable navigation of sailing robots, which rely only on wind for propulsion. Considering the aero and hydrodynamic disturbances from the environment, this task is extremely challenging. As a core member of my research team, I have been devoted to the front line of ocean experiments for a long time, and strive to help promote the research programs.</p>

    <p><li>ICRA2024: A turning radius prediction scheme for sailing robots under complex marine environment. Proposed a turning radius estimation scheme based on Gaussian process regression for sailing in complex marine environment. The influence of tides has been thoroughly analyzed. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme have been validated in both simulation and marine experiments. Under experimental circumstances, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the turning radius produced by the trained prediction model is 0.58m. </p>

    <p><li>ICRA2023: Stable Station Keeping of Autonomous Sailing Robots via the Switched Systems Approach for Ocean Observation. Proposed a stable station keeping approach by reciprocating smoothly in the goal observation area and collecting data. An acceptable circular ring was designed for turning buffer. Hereby, stability of switched systems was guranteed with Lyapunov function. Achieved long-term ocean observation by proposing a stable station keeping scheme based on a swithed system approach. The sailing robot realized stable reciprocating observation in a circular area with a radius of 0.78km, lasting more than 24 hours.</p>

    <p><li>RAL2021: A Kelvin Wake Avoidance Scheme for Autonomous Sailing Robots Based on Orientation-restricted Dubin Path. Wakes generated by surrounding moving vessels are swift and can have severe adverse effects on a sailboat by causing it to veer off course, stall or capsize. Moreover, sailboats have low mobility and large inertia and will therefore struggle to avoid a wake. Thus, we proposed an orientation-restricted Dubins path-based Kelvin wake-avoidance method. In simulation and experiments, the maximum range of roll in alongside scenario and maximum range of surge acceleration in toward scenario are reduced.</p>

    <p><li>ICRA2021: Collision Risk Assessment and Obstacle Avoidance Control for Autonomous Sailing Robots. Proposed a novel sailboat safety zone (SSZ) to show the regional distribution of collision risk dynamically. Both intrinsic characteristics of OceanVoy and the complex environmental factors such as wind, waves, tides and obstacles at sea have been considered. To the best knowledge of us, it is the first efficient risk assessment scheme for sailing robots in the world. A collision avoidance algorithm has been designed based on SSZ for safe sailing in real marine environment.</p>
